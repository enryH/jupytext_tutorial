# Jupytext tutorial

## Small example notebook

1. Explore a notebook structure
2. Add percentage script from notebook (see instruction in `hello.ipynb`)
3. Run percentage script in VSCode
4. Reload changes in JupyterLab
5. Execute notebook using papermill


Playground, potential things to try in VSCode:

1. Refactor (e.g. a DataFrame name) across cells
2. Diffing of `.py` and `.ipynb` files in VSCode, stagging parts of a file
3. Live exploration of docstrings and object attributes (in JupyterLab vs. VSCode)
